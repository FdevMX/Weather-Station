# MySimpleConnection

## What is it?
A simple connection class that uses the MySql.Data connector.

## Some particular origin?
I was tired of copying the same connection class file for every small project I created, so I decided to turn it into a NuGet Package.

## Can I use it in any type of project?
Yes, go ahead, I have no problem with it.
